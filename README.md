#  AI-Powered Medical Report Analyzer

This project uses **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, and **transformers** to analyze and summarize medical reports in XML or PDF format, and predict the patient's medical condition using natural language processing (NLP).

---

##  Features

-  Extracts and reads medical reports (XML and PDF support)
-  Summarizes medical reports in plain English
-  Predicts likely patient condition using AI
-  User-friendly Streamlit interface
-  FastAPI backend for processing and inference

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 1.  Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have requirements.txt, you can create it using pip freeze > requirements.txt.

2.  Start the FastAPI Server
bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn backend:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Then open your browser and visit:


http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
You’ll see the Swagger UI where you can test the API.

3.  Run the Streamlit Interface
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run ui.py
Enter or paste a medical report in the textbox and click "Analyze Report". You’ll see a summary and condition prediction based on the content.

 Technologies Used
FastAPI – for the backend REST API

Streamlit – for the interactive web UI

Hugging Face Transformers – for summarization and classification

PyMuPDF / fitz – for reading PDFs

xml.etree.ElementTree – for parsing XML files

FAISS (optional) – for semantic search over reports

 Future Enhancements
 Upload multiple reports at once

 Dashboard view for summarized reports

 Save analysis results to a database

 Fine-tune models on medical data for higher accuracy
